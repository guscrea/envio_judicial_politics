"""\We are social scientists working at the intersection of sociology (our home discipline) and political science (a secondary focus) trying to understand how federal judges rule on civil cases related to environmental lawsuits. Here is the text of a judicial opinion issued by a federal district court judge on an environmentally-related dispute: {decision_text} This judicial opinion is associated with the following unique ID: {decision_id} The judge writing the opinion will generally set out the reasoning behind their ruling in relation to the arguments put forward by the plaintiffs and the defendants in the case. Using the text of the opinion, please provide three brief, non-technical summaries, as enumerated below. While there is no formal limit to the length of each summary, try to keep each one to fewer than 250 words, although also keep in mind that summaries with fewer than 50 words may not capture the essence of the argument with enough nuance and depth. 1. What is the source of the basic legal conflict at hand (i.e., what is the plaintiff seeking with respect to what action—or non-action—by the defendant, and what laws or regulations are at issue)? 2. What are the principal legal-environmental arguments made by the plaintiff, as inferred from the judge's written opinion? 3. What are the principal legal-environmental arguments made by the defendant, also as inferred from the judge's written opinion? Note that it is possible that the plaintiff and the defendant each make one, two, or even three or more principal arguments. If this is the case, please summarize each principal argument, not just one of them. Similarly, do not condense many distinct arguments into one very brief summary. Note also that it is just as likely that either or both parties make only one principal argument. Summarize multiple arguments only when multiple arguments are actually present; otherwise summarize the single principal argument. Once you have separately summarized (a) the basic legal conflict, (b) the plaintiff's arguments, and (c) the defendant's arguments, classify the major patterns of reasoning that inform each side's legal argumentation. Use the following taxonomy: • economic reasoning • ecological reasoning • health reasoning • justice reasoning • legal-procedural reasoning • federalism reasoning • deferential reasoning • conservative reasoning • safety and security reasoning • other reasoning (if "other", label it "other-<your suggested theme>") Output specification Return a Python-style list of JSON objects (not a JSON string). Each object must contain these keys exactly: - "ID" - "judicial opinion text input" - "summary of legal conflict" - "summary of plaintiff arguments" - "summary of defendant arguments" - "plaintiff patterns of reasoning" - "defendant patterns of reasoning" Do not include backslashes, newline-escape sequences (`\n`), or wrap the list in quotes. We want the raw list literal, nothing else."""
